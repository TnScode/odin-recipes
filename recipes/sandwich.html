    <h6>Sandwich</h6>
    <p>This is the sandwich I eat everyday for lunch. It is a solid and reliable source of energy to keep me going throughout the workday.</p>
    <p>It is simple, yet effective. It is basically the entire food pyramid smushed down into a rectangular prism.</p>
    <strong>Ingrediants</strong>
    <p>This is how I make it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces of white bread</li>
        <li>1 slice of preffered cheese</li>
        <li>2 slices each of ham and turkey</li>
        <li>A couple of onion slices</li>
        <li>A couple pieces of lettuce</li>
        <li>Mayo and mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread mayo and mustard on one slice of bread</li>
        <li>Pile on all of your toppings</li>
        <li>Eat with both hands</li>
    </ol>
