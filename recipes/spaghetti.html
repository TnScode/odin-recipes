    <h6>Spaghetti and Meatballs</h6>
    <p>This delious meal has been a stable in my diet since I was a small child. My mom makes the best spaghetti and meatballs, and she's not even Italian!</p>
    <p>My father however, is Italian, that could be the reason I ate it so much growing up. Either way I can't complain, and I couldn't be happier!</p>
    <strong>Ingrediants</strong>
    <p>This is how I make it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 can of red sauce</li>
        <li>1 large pot of boiling water</li>
        <li>1 lightly oiled pan</li>
        <li>1-2 handfulls of spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>grocery store garlic bread</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>boil some lightly salted water</li>
        <li>ball up 4-6 meatballs and place them in your lightly oiled pan</li>
        <li>periodically stir noodles while keeping an eye on the meatballs</li>
        <li>slowly rotate meatballs after they start to brown</li>
        <li>once meatballs are done drain grease and pour in your red sauce</li>
        <li>strain noodles and serve</li>
    </ol>
