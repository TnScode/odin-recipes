    <h6>Cereal</h6>
    <p>Cereal is simple and tasty. It is a fast and easy breakfast, and also good as a midnight snack to subside your munchies.</p>
    <p>It is sweet, crunchy, and milky. I can't think of a better invention.</p>
    <strong>Ingrediants</strong>
    <p>This is how I make it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cereal of choice</li>
        <li>Milk of choice</li>
        <li>Spoon of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Important!!!</strong>Pour cereal first</li>
        <li>Followed by the milk</li>
        <li>Eat with spoon</li>
        <li>Drink the milk after cereal is gone</li>
    </ol>
