This is my first attempt at building a practice website for the Odin Project curriculum.

At the end of this, when the site is completed I will hope to have a fundamental understanding of:
- comfotably setting up a website and a repository
- get comfortable with making good commits through GitHub
- be more fluid with my movement through the command line
- have a nice asthetic with the information and pictures shown
- have a fully accesible site

reflection after:
After completing the Odin recipes project I have gotten a better feel for how commits work and how to seemlessly create new pages and link them together through "a href".
Next I hope to learn how to make clean and nice looking webpages using CSS and JavaScript.
